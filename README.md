# MyJournal App

This is a journaling application built using NPM, React, GraphQL, and AWS Amplify. The application allows users to create, read, and share journal entries.

## Getting Started

To get started with this application, you will need to have Node.js and NPM installed on your machine. You will also need an AWS account and an AWS Amplify project set up.

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git

Install dependencies: npm install

Configure AWS Amplify: amplify configure

Initialize the project: amplify init

Deploy the backend: amplify push

Start the development server: npm starts


## Usage
To use the application, navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser. You will be prompted to sign in or create an account. Once you have signed in, you will be taken to the main dashboard where you can create new journal entries, view existing entries, and delete or update entries as needed.

The application uses GraphQL to communicate with the backend and AWS Amplify to manage authentication, authorization, and data storage.
